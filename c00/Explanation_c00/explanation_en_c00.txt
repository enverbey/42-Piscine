ex(00) ft_putchar : this function takes a value type of char and print it on terminal. 

Signature of function write -> 	ssize_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count);
					I used	->	write(1, &c, 1);
You must know these :

	-> fd : file destription, we usually use 1 to print on terminal.
	-> buf : Buf is a pointer to the starting address of the data to be written.
			The write function expect a pointer to the buf parameter. 
			Because of buf, we use '&' with c. C is a variable type of char but buf expect a pointer.
	-> & : The "&" operator is used to get the memory address of a variable.
	-> count : It is used to  determine how many bytes will be written from the data at buf.
